Figure out how to Show timings of midis.
Add right-click menu for items in list -- add-ons menu (haven't made addon stuff yet though)
Addon ideas:
	Save as wav
	Show instruments
	Add another window like Be's included Midi application + pan, +rate
	Reveal in tracker
	Piano player
	Cut and pasting of midis
